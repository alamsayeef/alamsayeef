I am an applied statistician interested in genetics, health economics outcomes and improving healthcare in general. To be more specific, I am interesed in statistical applications in genetic epidemiology, economic evaluations, and quantitative public health issues.

A lot of what I currently work on has to do with precision medicine; specifically with determining meaningful or causal statistical associations in high dimensional data. Generating polygenic risk scores (a.k.a. PRS) which is a representation of the total number of genetic variants that an individual carries. It can be used to assess the degree of heritable risk or protection towards the disease/disorder of interest. It can be used for enhanced screening, in risk stratification of the sample and potentially provide an early intervention. Overall its clinical outcome would help ameliorate individual's health status. 

I am avid programmer and enjoy discussing about statistically feasible approaches to unique problems with data that usually arises among non-statisticians. I have experience working as an associate at Parexel, where we developed Shiny applications in R which could conduct and visualize economics evaluation methods like cost-effectiveness/benifit analysis and also visualized comparative parametric survival models. I also am skilled in building dynamic dashboards, conducting network meta analysis, indirect treatment comparisons. I take special interest in R.
