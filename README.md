I am an applied statistician interested in problems arising from genetics, computer science and public health disciplines. To be more specific, I am interesed in statistical applications in genetic epidemiology, economic evaluations, and quantitative social sciences. 

A lot of what I currently work on has to do with genetic risk scores (a.k.a. PRS). A PRS is a nothing but the representation of the total number of genetic variants that an individual has. It can be used to assess the degree of heritable risk for a particular disease. I am fascinated with it because of its application, it can be used for enhance screening, it also helps in risk stratification of the sample and which in turn would help in providing an early intervention. All in all if properly implemented its clinical outcome would help ameliorate individual's health status. I am avid fan of programming and data in general, but due to my background I take special interest in the healthcare domain. I have experience working in the analytics team of a pharmaceutical company where we developed economics evaluation models, dashboards and conducted network meta analysis to satisfy client needs. Having said that I would consider myself to be adequately proficient in R along with other statistical programming languages.
